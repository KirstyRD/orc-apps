This software module was originally developed by 
Eduardo Juarez, Wei Jianguo and Ren Rong, 
in the course of development of the ISO/IEC 23002-5 (Video Tool Library) 
for reference purposes and its performance may not have been optimized. 
This software module is an implementation of one or more tools as 
specified by the ISO/IEC 23002-5.

ISO/IEC gives You a royalty-free, worldwide, non-exclusive, copyright 
license to copy, distribute, and make derivative works of this software 
module or modifications thereof for use in implementations of the 
ISO/IEC 23002-5 in products that satisfy conformance criteria (if any). 

Those intending to use this software module in products are advised that 
its use may infringe existing patents. ISO/IEC have no liability for use 
of this software module or modifications thereof.

Copyright is not released for products that do not conform to audiovisual 
and image-coding related ITU Recommendations and/or ISO/IEC International 
Standards.

Assurance that the originally developed software module can be used 
(1) in the ISO/IEC 23002-5 once the ISO/IEC 23002-5 has been adopted; and 
(2) to develop the ISO/IEC 23002-5: 

UPM grants ISO/IEC all rights necessary to 
include the originally developed software module or modifications thereof 
in the ISO/IEC 23002-5 and to permit ISO/IEC to offer You a royalty-free, 
worldwide, non-exclusive, copyright license to copy, distribute, and make 
derivative works for use in implementations of the ISO/IEC 23002-5 in 
products that satisfy conformance criteria (if any), and to the extent 
that such originally developed software module or portions of it are 
included in the ISO/IEC 23002-5.  To the extent that UPM
owns patent rights that would be required to make, use, or 
sell the originally developed software module or portions thereof 
included in the ISO/IEC 23002-5 in a conforming product, UPM
will assure the ISO/IEC that it is willing to 
negotiate licenses under reasonable and non-discriminatory terms and 
conditions with applicants throughout the world.
